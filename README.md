## A Hackathon Challenge: Analyzing Solar Generation and Battery Usage 

Create a project that analyzes solar electricity generation, electricity usage, and battery usage data to understand the potential benefits of using a battery system to store excess solar electricity. 

The participants are required to utilize SQL and Python programming language and various libraries, including pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib for data visualization, and datetime for handling time-related data.


You can download the data for this project here, (it is an excel workbook)
